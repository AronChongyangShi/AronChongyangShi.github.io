Network science project in SUSTech.

<font size=1>The movies of Marvel universe are very popular among young people. Almost every
young people nowadays know some of the heroes in Marvel universe, such as iron man and
spider man. The data set named The Marvel Universe Social Network (MUSN) describe
the social relationships of the heroes. By analyzing the MUSN, we establish a social
network of Marvel heroes. We derive some basic statistics from the Marvel network, such
as the number of nodes and links, the hubs, the components, the shortest path lengths
and the diameter. In the next part, we analyze the structure of the Marvel network
and obtain some results of the connectedness, the clustering, the degree distribution, the
degree correlation. Meanwhile, we fit the power law and divide the network into different
communities. In this process, we not only find that the network appears to have the small
world nature, since it is obviously a scale-free network, but also find that it is very similar
to the real-world social network. Further, based on the work of Loverkar et al., we do
a hypothesis test on the small world nature of the network. We find that the Marvel
network does have small world property. In the end, we visualize the Marvel network to
give a better understanding of the network.</font>

Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2021.

Currently, a species invasion event has occurred in Washington State. Bumblebees from East Asia invaded
Washington State. The Asian Hornet has had a serious impact on the local ecology and life.In order to predict and control the spread of these pests, we have established some mathematical models. Through these models, we will make some suggestions for pest prevention and control. In this article, the main problem we face is the imbalance of the sample. In the case where the negative sample is much larger than the positive sample, we use the data augmentation algorithm. The main work of this article focuses on data prediction. We have used some machine learning models and some techniques in NLP and CV to solve this problem and obtain high-precision prediction results.
