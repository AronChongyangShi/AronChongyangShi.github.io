### About Me

I am a senior undergraduate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Southern University of Science and Technology. My advisor is Prof. Bingyi Jing. I am currently in a research program of the National University of Singapore and my supervisor is Professor Wang Zhou.

Now I want to apply for a PhD position to continue to enrich my academic life. If you want to know more about me. Here is [my CV](http://AronChongyangShi.github.io/files/CV.pdf). And my email is aron.c.shi@gmail.com.

There are some of my work on this website, if you are interested, you can also take a look.

Thanks for your attention to me.

### Research Interest

My current research interests lie in statistical machine leaning and control theory, especially reinforcement learning. My secondary research interest is data science and its applications on network data. After getting the admission of Ph.D. program, I will continue my academic journey on developing machine learning methods to solve interesting and practical problems in robotics, neuroscience, and social science.
