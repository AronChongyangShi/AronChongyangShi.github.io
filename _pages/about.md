### About Me

I am a senior undergraduate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Southern University of Science and Technology. My advisor is Prof. Bingyi Jing. I am currently in a research program of the National University of Singapore under the supervision of Professor Wang Zhou.

Now I want to apply for a PhD position to continue to enrich my academic life. If you want to know more about me. Here is [my CV](http://AronChongyangShi.github.io/files/CV.pdf). And my email is aron.c.shi@gmail.com.

There are some of my work on this website, if you are interested, you can also take a look.

Thanks for your attention to me.

### Research Interest

I'm interested in statistical machine leaning and control theory, especially reinforcement learning. My secondary interest is data science and its applications on network data. I am now committed to developing new machine learning methods to solve important problems in artificial intelligence and neuroscience.
