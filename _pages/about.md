### About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at [Uiversity of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) (UF). My advisor is [Dr. Jie Fu](https://fujie.ece.ufl.edu/).  I earned my B.S. degree in Statistics from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China in 2022.

In 2016, when I was a high school student, I saw Alphago beat Lee Sedol on TV. After that, I was fascinated by the power of AI. That's why I choose to work on game theory and reinforcement learning. For some reason, my undergraduate major was statistics. That didn't dampen my enthusiasm for AI. On the contrary, the knowledge of statistics has given me an advantage in machine learning. Now I am facing new challenges at UF. Hope I could solve more engineering problems and get my Ph.D. degree in the future.

### Research Interest

My research interests lie in game theory and control theory. I'm currently working on some problems on stochastic games. I enjoy making powerful game AI and analyze the effectiveness of different algorithms.
