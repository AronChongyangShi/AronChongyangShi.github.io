### About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department department at [Uiversity of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) (UF). My advisor is [Dr. Jie Fu](https://fujie.ece.ufl.edu/).  I earned my B.S. degree in Statistics from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China in 2022.

In 2016, when I was a high school student, I saw Alphago beat Lee Sedol on TV. This scene completely shocked me, but I believe that the potential of AI goes far beyond this. That's why I choose to work on game theory and reinforcement learning. Sure enough, with the appearance of chatGPT in 2022, it has brought us a brand new industrial revolution. I am very honored to be involved in the development and construction of AI.

### Research Interest

My research interests lie in game theory and control theory. I'm currently working on some problems on stochastic games. In addition to that, my research is related to discrete event system and opacity.
